\section{Introduction}
	The objective of this exercise is the creation and the performance evaluation of a high gain
	and directional Wi-Fi antenna. The effectiveness of the antenna will be evaluated in comparison with an omnidirectional and a professional Wi-Fi antenna. The design that we chose to build is a cantenna. Cantenna is a homemade directional waveguide antenna, made out of an open-ended metal can.

\section{Theoretical background of the cantenna}
	The cantenna we built is a cylindrical directional waveguide antenna. This kind of waveguide supports both traverse electric (TE) and traverse magnetic (TM) modes. The traverse modes are a particular electromagnetic field pattern of radiation measured in a plane perpendicular (i.e., transverse) to the propagation direction of the beam. They have a cutoff frequency, below which electromagnetic energy is severely attenuated and above this, the certain mode is excited. An ideal cantenna has only one mode, the dominant one, which is the $TE_{11}$, because our cantenna is a cylindrical waveguide. If the cantenna excites more than one modes, the effectiveness of the antenna will decrease, because the energy of the electromagnetic wave will be spread within different modes. The mode that we do not want to trigger is the $TM_{10}$.
	
	
	\subsection{Cantenna design parameters}
		For our cantenna to work properly, some geometric properties need to be calculated first.
		The cantenna used in this exercise will use the Wi-Fi channel $6$ with central frequency $2.437$GHz and wavelength $12.31$cm.
		
		\subsubsection{Can diameter}
			The cantenna should trigger the dominant mode $TE_{11}$ only. This happens at any frequency higher then the cutoff frequency $f_{c,TE_{11}}$. No other mode is triggered for frequencies below $f_{c,TE_{11}}$, because waves are attenuated exponentially.
			The second mode is the $TM_{10}$ and if the frequency is greater than the cutoff frequency $f_{c,TM_{10}}$, both the two first modes will be excited.
			We thus deduce that the Wi-Fi frequency $f_{Wi-Fi}$ has to fulfill the following inequality:
			\begin{equation}
				f_{c,TE_{11}} < f_{Wi-Fi} < f_{c,TM_{10}}
			\end{equation}.
			
			The formulas for the above two frequencies for the cylindrical waveguide are the following\cite{waveguide}:
			\begin{equation}
				\frac{p_{11} c}{\pi f_{WiFi}} < D < \frac{p_{01}' c}{\pi f_{WiFi}}
			\end{equation}
			where $p_{11}' = 1.841$ and $p_{01}= 2.405$ are parameters related to the Bessel function and $c$ the speed of light.
			This yields in
			\begin{equation}
				72.18mm < D < 94mm
			\end{equation}
			Therefore the diameter of our cantenna has to be between these limits.
			
		\subsubsection{Position of the copper element: Acts as the monopole} \label{mono:pos}
			Not only that certain modes are triggered, when the electro magnetic wave of the Wi-Fi signal reaches the cantenna. The wave inside the can is also reflected by its bottom. This results in the creation of a static wave.
			The wavelength $\lambda_g$ of the static wave inside of the can is equal to the wavelength of the mode that is triggered. In our case we want to trigger only the dominant mode $TE_{11}$.
			Placing the monopole, we must take into consideration the frequency of this static wave.
			The static wave is a sinusoid, so we know its highest amplitude can be found at a distance of $\frac{\lambda_g}{4}$ from the can bottom.
			Since we know $\lambda_g = 176.56 mm$ as a property of the $TE_{11}$ mode\cite{can:lambdag}, we placed the monopole at a distance of $\frac{\lambda_g}{4} = 44.14 mm$ from the can bottom. The monopole is a piece of copper wire placed orthogonally to the can surface pointing inwards.
		
		\subsubsection{Monopole length}
			The monopole antenna is a class of radio antenna consisting of a straight rod-shaped conductor, often mounted perpendicularly over some type of conductive surface, called a plane ground. In our case, we decided to built the most common type of the monopole, which is the quarter-wave monopole. It is also called \emph{Marconi antenna}. This monopole is ideal for our configuration, because it is simple and it has the right dimensions, in order to fit inside the cantenna. The length of the monopole is equal to $\frac{1}{\lambda_{Wi-Fi}}$. Where  $\lambda_{Wi-Fi}$ is the wavelength of the Wi-Fi signal. In the current setup $\lambda_{Wi-Fi} = 123mm$, so the length of the monopole is $30.75mm$.
		
		\subsubsection{Length of the can}
			The length of the can has to be more than $\frac{3}{4} \lambda_g = 132.42mm$. The longer the cantenna is the more directional and effective becomes. In our case, the length of the cantenna is $160mm$, so we expect to be directional.
	
	\subsection{Cantenna theoretical and experimental device dimensions} 
		In \autoref{can:geom}, we present the theoretical design parameters of the cantenna and the actual ones of our setup. Our cantenna satisfies all the design prerequisites and thus, we expect it to work fairly well regarding antenna gain and directivity.

\section{Setup}	
	
	\subsection{Terminology}
		The machine serving as stationary receiver connected to the cantenna is denoted by \rc. It is the one performing all measurements. The machine used as access point is called \ap. It is moved around and sending traffic to the \rc.
	
	\subsection{Materials}
		The materials and the equipment that were used for the creation and the setup of the antenna are the following: 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $2$ Notebooks
			\item {\emph{$1$ USB Alfa wireless adapter:} Is the wireless adapter connected to \rc. The antennas are connected to this interface.} 
			\item {\emph{$1$ TP-Link wireless adapter:} Is used by the \ap.}
			\item {\emph{$1$ Pigtail cable:} Is used to connect the cantenna with the USB Alfa wireless adapter.}
			\item {\emph{$1$ female N-connector}}
			\item {\emph{$1$ piece of copper wire:} Is used as the active element, the monopole, that radiates the waves}
			\item {\emph{$1$ cylindrical can:} Plays the role of the Wi-fi antenna.} 
			\item \emph{ifconfig}: Is used to configure the network interfaces.
			\item \emph{iwconfig}: Is used to configure the \emph{wireless} network interfaces.
			\item \emph{iperf}: Network testing tool for creating data streams and measuring throughput.
			\item \emph{iptraf}: Monitoring network interface throughput.
			\item \emph{hostapd}: Is a user space deamon for Access Point and authentication servers.
			\item \emph{netcat}: Used as a chat channel to communicate over larger distances.
		\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Setting up the experiment}
		\paragraph{Wi-Fi channel}: We used Wi-Fi channel $6$.
		\paragraph{Distance meassurement} We placed markers on the ground (see \autoref{marks}) at the distances of 1m, 10m, 20m, 40m, 60m, 80m, 100m. To measure the distance we used GPS and counting steps, which resulted in a maximum difference of less than 2m.

		\subsection{Gain measurements}
			We observed the way the signal strength changes when increasing the distance between the \ap and the \rc. This experiment was executed for three different antennas: an omnidirectional antenna, a professional cantenna and our cantenna.
			In order to be the measurements accurate, they were taken in an open area field. We chose the place seen in \autoref{distance} in order to avoid environmental effects, such as reflections by buildings, scattering by moving objects.

		\subsection{Directionality measurements}
			In the second phase of the experiment measured the directionality of each of the above antennas. All the measurements for the three antennas were taken in $20$m distance from the Access Point. The starting point of the measurements was considered the one with $0^{\circ}$. Every next measurement was taken every $20^{\circ}$.

		\subsection{Maximum distance measurements}
			To see how far we can transmit using our cantenna, we increased the distance in steps of 20m starting at 100m. To check the connection, we used \emph{netcat} to send messages and \emph{ping}.
