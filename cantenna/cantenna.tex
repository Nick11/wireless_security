\section{Introduction}
	The objective of this exercise is the creation and the performance evaluation of a high gain
	and directional Wi-Fi antenna. The effectiveness of the antenna will be evaluated in comparison with an omnidirectional and a professional Wi-Fi antenna. The design that we chose to build is a cantenna. Cantenna is a homemade directional waveguide antenna, made out of an open-ended metal can.

\section{Theoretical background of the cantenna}
	The cantenna we built is a cylindrical directional waveguide antenna. This kind of waveguide supports both traverse electric (TE) and traverse magnetic (TM) modes. The traverse modes are a particular electromagnetic field pattern of radiation measured in a plane perpendicular (i.e., transverse) to the propagation direction of the beam. They have a cutoff frequency, below which electromagnetic energy is severely attenuated and above this, the certain mode is excited. An ideal cantenna has only one mode, the dominant one, which is the $TE_{11}$, because our cantenna is a cylindrical waveguide. If the cantenna excites more than one modes, the effectiveness of the antenna will decrease, because the energy of the electromagnetic wave will be spread within different modes. The mode that we do not want to trigger is the $TM_{10}$.
	
	
	\subsection{Cantenna design parameters}
		For our cantenna to work properly, some geometric properties need to be calculated first.
		The cantenna used in this exercise will use the Wi-Fi channel $6$ with central frequency $2.437$GHz and wavelength $12.31$cm.
		
		\subsubsection{Can diameter}
			The cantenna should trigger the dominant mode $TE_{11}$ only. This happens at any frequency higher then the cutoff frequency $f_{c,TE_{11}}$. No other mode is triggered for frequencies below $f_{c,TE_{11}}$, because waves are attenuated exponentially.
			The second mode is the $TM_{10}$ and if the frequency is greater than the cutoff frequency $f_{c,TM_{10}}$, both the two first modes will be excited.
			We thus deduce that the Wi-Fi frequency $f_{Wi-Fi}$ has to fulfill the following inequality:
			\begin{equation}
				f_{c,TE_{11}} < f_{Wi-Fi} < f_{c,TM_{10}}
			\end{equation}.
			
			The formulas for the above two frequencies for the cylindrical waveguide are the following\cite{waveguide}:
			\begin{equation}
				\frac{p_{11} c}{\pi f_{WiFi}} < D < \frac{p_{01}' c}{\pi f_{WiFi}}
			\end{equation}
			where $p_{11}' = 1.841$ and $p_{01}= 2.405$ are parameters related to the Bessel function and $c$ the speed of light.
			This yields in
			\begin{equation}
				72.18mm < D < 94mm
			\end{equation}
			Therefore the diameter of our cantenna has to be between these limits.
			
		\subsubsection{Position of the copper element: Acts as the monopole} \label{mono:pos}
			Not only that certain modes are triggered, when the electro magnetic wave of the Wi-Fi signal reaches the cantenna. The wave inside the can is also reflected by its bottom. This results in the creation of a static wave.
			The wavelength $\lambda_g$ of the static wave inside of the can is equal to the wavelength of the mode that is triggered. In our case we want to trigger only the dominant mode $TE_{11}$.
			Placing the monopole, we must take into consideration the frequency of this static wave.
			The static wave is a sinusoid, so we know its highest amplitude can be found at a distance of $\frac{\lambda_g}{4}$ from the can bottom.
			Since we know $\lambda_g = 176.56 mm$ as a property of the $TE_{11}$ mode\cite{can:lambdag}, we placed the monopole at a distance of $\frac{\lambda_g}{4} = 44.14 mm$ from the can bottom. The monopole is a piece of copper wire placed orthogonally to the can surface pointing inwards.
		
		\subsubsection{Monopole length}
			The monopole antenna is a class of radio antenna consisting of a straight rod-shaped conductor, often mounted perpendicularly over some type of conductive surface, called a plane ground. In our case, we decided to built the most common type of the monopole, which is the quarter-wave monopole. It is also called \emph{Marconi antenna}. This monopole is ideal for our configuration, because it is simple and it has the right dimensions, in order to fit inside the cantenna. The length of the monopole is equal to $\frac{1}{\lambda_{Wi-Fi}}$. Where  $\lambda_{Wi-Fi}$ is the wavelength of the Wi-Fi signal. In the current setup $\lambda_{Wi-Fi} = 123mm$, so the length of the monopole is $30.75mm$.
		
		\subsubsection{Length of the can}
			The length of the can has to be more than $\frac{3}{4} \lambda_g = 132.42mm$. The longer the cantenna is the more directional and effective becomes. In our case, the length of the cantenna is $160mm$, so we expect to be directional.
	
	\subsection{Cantenna theoretical and experimental device dimensions} 
		In \autoref{can:geom}, we present the theoretical design parameters of the cantenna and the actual ones of our setup. Our cantenna satisfies all the design prerequisites and thus, we expect it to work fairly well regarding antenna gain and directivity.

\section{Setup}	
	In the following section we describe the experiment's setup.
	\subsection{Terminology}
		The machine serving as stationary receiver connected to the cantenna is denoted by \rc. It is the one performing all measurements. The machine used as access point is called \ap. It is moved around and sending traffic to the \rc.

		\paragraph{Wi-Fi channel}: We used Wi-Fi channel $6$.
		\paragraph{Distance meassurement} We placed markers on the ground (see \autoref{marks}) at the distances of 1m, 10m, 20m, 40m, 60m, 80m, 100m. To measure the distance we used GPS and counting steps, which resulted in a maximum difference of less than 2m.

		\subsection{Gain measurements}
			We observed the way the signal strength changes when increasing the distance between the \ap and the \rc. This experiment was executed for three different antennas: an omnidirectional antenna, a professional cantenna and our cantenna.
			In order to be the measurements accurate, they were taken in an open area field. We chose the place seen in \autoref{distance} in order to avoid environmental effects, such as reflections by buildings, scattering by moving objects.

		\subsection{Directionality measurements}
			In the second phase of the experiment measured the directionality of each of the above antennas. All the measurements for the three antennas were taken in $20$m distance from the Access Point. The starting point of the measurements was considered the one with $0^{\circ}$. Every next measurement was taken every $20^{\circ}$.

		\subsection{Maximum distance measurements}
			To see how far we can transmit using our cantenna, we increased the distance in steps of 20m starting at 100m. To check the connection, we used \emph{netcat} to send messages and \emph{ping}.
		
\section{Results}
	All results of the measurements can be found in the Appendix in \autoref{appendix}.
	\subsection{Gain measurements}
		
		\paragraph{Signal Strength} The results of the measurements can be found in the Appendix as Tables \autoref{dist:can}, \autoref{dist:prof}, \autoref{dist:omni} and as plots \autoref{img:dist:pow:can}, \autoref{img:dist:pow:prof}, \autoref{img:dist:pow:omni}.
		
		In \autoref{all:power} we observe that all antennas mostly behave according to the \emph{Free space loss} model.
		We observe some anomalies though. We assume that these are due to reflections and scattering on moving objects like cars and static objects as a fence and the road.
		
		The antennas behave comparable regarding the measured signal strength. The directional antennas did not clearly outperform the onmi-directional, which is rather surprising. Opposed to the omni-directional antenna, the cantennas were connected to the adapter using a cable which could result in some performance loss.
		
		\paragraph{Bandwidth} \autoref{img:dist:band:can} to \autoref{img:dist:band:omni} show the bandwidth measurement. We observe an average bandwidth of roughly 6 Mib/s for our cantenna, 8 Mib/s for the professional cantenna and 5.5 Mib/s for the omni-directional antenna.
		The cantennas outperform the omni-directional antenna by a factor of up to 1.45. This is not reflected in the signal strength measurements. We could not explicitly identify the cause of this phenomenon.
		The bandwidth does not decrease with increasing distance. The signal is still strong enough at a distance of 100m to not get a significant error-rate. This changes for higher distances, see \autoref{max:dist}.
		
		%TODO: Comment on the results ("bandwidth behaves like this and that...")
		%TODO: compare antennas
		%TODO: discuss anomalies?

		\end{figure}

	\subsection{Directionality measurements}
		\paragraph{Signal strength} The results can be found in \autoref{img:ang:pow:can} \autoref{img:ang:pow:omni} and \autoref{ang:can} to \autoref{ang:omni}.
		
		To measure the directionality we use two measures. The \emph{half-power beam width}, the angle between the half-power pints of the main lobe.
		And the \emph{front-to-back ratio}, th ratio of power-gain between the front and the rear of the antenna.
		
		
		For our cantenna the \emph{half-power beam width} is $70^{\circ}$ and the \emph{front-to-back ratio} is $22$dB. For the professional antenna we got a \emph{half-power beam width} of approximately $80^{\circ}$ and a \emph{front-to-back ratio} of $11$dB.
		The omni-directional has a maximum at $0^{\circ}$ and a minimum at $180^{\circ}$ but for the other angles the gain is almost constant, as expected for a omni-directional antenna.
		
		\paragraph{Bandwidth}
		The result of the bandwidth measurements can be seen in \autoref{img:ang:band:can} to \autoref{img:ang:band:omni} and \autoref{ang:can} to \autoref{ang:omni}.
		The bandwidth and the signal strength do not correlate for the directional antennas. The maximum can be found at around $240^{\circ}$ and not at $0^{\circ}$ where we expected it. We assume this is due to our hasty measurement methodology because we can not come up with any other explanation.
		
		
	\subsection{Maximum distance measurements}\label{max:dist}
		Using our cantenna we could go up to 250m before losing the connection.
		The signal strength decreased drastically at a distance of 240m (-70dBm)while the bandwidth was stable up to 140m (4.5Mib/s) and decreased to 800Kib/s at 250m where we lost the connection.
				

\section{Conclusion}
	We achieved to build high-gain directional antenna that provides a \emph{higher bandwidth} than the omni-directional antenna.
	Regarding their \emph{signal strength} all three antennas perform similarly. This is rather 
	Even though we measured outdoors, we observed some \emph{anomalies} due to environmental effects and measurement errors.
	The maximum distance of 250m we could reach, implies a potential benefit for real life applications.
